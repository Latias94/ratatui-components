# ratatui-components

High-level, batteries-included components for building modern TUIs with
[ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui).

This project focuses on filling ecosystem gaps with reusable components inspired by
Charmbracelet’s Bubble Tea ecosystem (e.g. Bubbles, Lip Gloss, Glow), with a particular
emphasis on AI-agent style CLIs (chat transcripts, diffs, rich text).

## Status

Early design stage. The first milestone is to ship an MVP that includes rich-text
rendering (Markdown + code + diff) and the foundational interactive building blocks
needed by agent CLIs.
